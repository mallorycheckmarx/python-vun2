## Software Process Report


###About reddit
Reddit is an entertainment, social networking, and news website where registered community members can submit content, such as text posts or direct links, making it essentially an online bulletin board system. 

Registered users can then vote submissions up or down to organize the posts and determine their position on the site's pages. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called "subreddits". 

The subreddit topics include news, gaming, movies, music, books, fitness, food, and photosharing, among many others.

####Programming Language
Reddit was originally written in Common Lisp but was rewritten in Python some months later.

The reasons given for the switch were wider access to code libraries and greater development flexibility.

Three years later the project was made available as an open source project and is now hosted on GitHub.

####History

**June 2005**: Reddit was founded in Medford by two 22-year-old graduates of the University of Virginia. 

**November 2005 - January2006**: Reddit merged with Aaron Swartz's company Infogami, and Swartz became an equal owner of the resulting parent company, Not A Bug. 

**October 2006**: Condé Nast Publications, owner of Wired, acquired Reddit and the team moved to San Francisco.

**January 2007**: Swartz was fired.

**End of 2008**: Team expanded.

**May 2010**: Reddit was named in Lead411's "2010 Hottest San Francisco Companies" list.

**July 2010**: After explosive traffic growth, Reddit introduced Reddit Gold, offering new features for a price of $3.99/month or $29.99/year. Reddit Gold adds a number of features to the interface, including the ability to display more comments on a page, access to the private subreddit /r/lounge, and notifications whenever one's username is mentioned in a comment.

**September 2011**: Reddit became operationally independent of Condé Nast, now operating as a separate subsidiary of its parent company, Advance Publications.

**February 2015**: Redditmade closed.

**July 2015**: Pao resigned and was replaced by Steve Huffman as CEO.


###Structure
Não nos foi possivel encontrar informação relativamente ao processo de desenvolvimento de software do Reddit principalmente devido ao facto de a grande parte da criação do mesmo ter sido em closed source, tendo apenas sido disponibilizado em open source depois do seu "release".

###Scrum
Scrum is a way of software development, where a team is required as solid to reach a goal.
Basically this methodology involves several's sprints, 1 to 3 weeks, having each sprint the follow structure:

1-Plan

2-Build

3-Test

4-Review

To get the final product its necessary 3 Rols. First its the Product owner, who will request the product and pay for it. In second we have the Scrum Master, its the one that will push for the team, helping ensuring success, removing impediments and supporting the team. Finally we have the team, who will build the project.

In the final of each sprint, team will dispute a sprint review (where team can improve the product) and a sprint retrospective (where team can be improved).

If the final product its built after the sprint, team can put the product ready for shippment.
