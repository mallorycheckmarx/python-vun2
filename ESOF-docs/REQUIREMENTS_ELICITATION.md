##Overview
The next chapter, the Overall Description section, of this document gives an overview of the functionality of the product. It describes the informal requirements and is used to establish a context for the technical requirements specification in the next chapter.
The third chapter, Requirements Specification section, of this document is written primarily for the developers and describes in technical terms the details of the functionality of the product. 


#Overall description
This section will give an overview of the whole system. The system will be explained in its context to
show how the system interacts with other systems and introduce the basic functionality of it. It will also
describe what type of stakeholders that will use the system and what functionality is available for each
type. At last, the constraints and assumptions for the system will be presented.

##Product perspective
Reddit stands out from other online bulletin board systems due to its open culture and focus in providing user insperd content.
It consists of a web portal used to view submissions, upvote or downvote them, access subreddits and user account management.

#Requirements Specification
All of the requirements come from the users of reddit that propose them and sometimes are also implemented by them.
##Externeal interface requirements
###User interfaces
The user is allowed to post a new thread, comment, upvote or downvote any thread and their comments.
The user can also set a flair for each subreddit he has subscribed, tag his own posts with reddit own-flairs (usually Spoilers or NSFW).
The user can also create his own subreddit, search for terms in all of the threads existing in a subreddit and send private messages to other users.
###Hardware interfaces
###Software interfaces
Reddit's interface is organized in 3 different sections, top bar, right sidebar and the body of the site.
The top bar shows the user all of the subreddit he has subscribed, a few default subreddits, the friends of the user, the subreddit banner and all of the different pages that can be acessed on the subreddit: the top, new, rising, controversial, hot and gilded pages.
The right sidebar contains the description and rules of the subreddit, the information on the number of people browsing at the moment and that the subscribers, the moderators and, sometimes, a calendar with events that are coming up.
The body is located on the center of the page and is the most important one. It has all of the threads, the number of upvotes/downvotes on each one and the user that created it.
