#Introduction
##Purpose

The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of Reddit.
It will illustrate the purpose and features of the system, what it will do and it's constraints.
This document is intended for both the developers and stakeholders of Reddit.

##Scope
Reddit is the engine that powers https://reddit.com, a community-focused online bulletin board system where registered users can post content, such as text, videos, photos or links.
Users can then vote submissions up or down influencing it's rank in the overall standings. 
Reddit's aim is to harbor an open nature and diverse user community where the community generates it's content.

##Overview
The next chapter, the Overall Description section, of this document gives an overview of the functionality of the product. It describes the informal requirements and is used to establish a context for the technical requirements specification in the next chapter.
The third chapter, Requirements Specification section, of this document is written primarily for the developers and describes in technical terms the details of the functionality of the product. 


#Overall description
This section will give an overview of the whole system. The system will be explained in its context to
show how the system interacts with other systems and introduce the basic functionality of it. It will also
describe what type of stakeholders that will use the system and what functionality is available for each
type. At last, the constraints and assumptions for the system will be presented.

##Product perspective
Reddit stands out from other online bulletin board systems due to its open culture and focus in providing user insperd content.
It consists of a web portal used to view submissions, upvote or downvote them, access subreddits and user account management.

##Product functions
Reddit has a lot of functions for a website, such as sending messages and archiving all of the threads that people have created. However, its main function is bringing news to everyone as quickly as possible and it gives the possibility for all of the users to share their opinions on whatever matter is being discussed.

#Requirements Specification
All of the requirements come from the users of reddit that propose them and sometimes are also implemented by them.
##External interface requirements
###User interfaces
The user is allowed to post a new thread, comment, upvote or downvote any thread and their comments.
The user can also set a flair for each subreddit he has subscribed, tag his own posts with reddit own-flairs (usually Spoilers or NSFW).
The user can also create his own subreddit, search for terms in all of the threads existing in a subreddit and send private messages to other users.
###Hardware interfaces
(to be done, what the hell is this)
###Software interfaces
Reddit's inrterface is organized in 3 different sections, top bar, right sidebar and the body of the site.
The top bar shows the user all of the subreddit he has subscribed, a few default subreddits, the friends of the user, the subreddit banner and all of the different pages that can be acessed on the subreddit: the top, new, rising, controversial, hot and gilded pages.
The right sideba contains the description and rules of the subreddit, the information on the number of people browsing at the moment and that the subscribers, the moderators and, sometimes, a calendar with events that are coming up.
The body is located on the center of the page and is the most important one. It has all of the threads, the number of upvotes/downvotes on each one and the user that created it.
###Communications interfaces
The communication interface can be done in a number of ways. First of, users can send each other private messages and communicate that way. However, as the whole idea of reddit is to bring the news as quickly as possible, users can communicate inside threads, replying to comments from each other.

#Performance requirements
Reddit's performance requirements keep increasing year by year. On 2013 it had 56 billion pageviews and 731 million unique pageviews. However, the servers just aren't enough. During heavy traffic times, the site usually goes down and needs maintenance.
