## Software Process Report

###About reddit
Reddit is an entertainment, social networking, and news website where registered community members can submit content, such as text posts or direct links, making it essentially an online bulletin board system. 

Registered users can then vote submissions up or down to organize the posts and determine their position on the site's pages. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called "subreddits". 

The subreddit topics include news, gaming, movies, music, books, fitness, food, and photosharing, among many others.

####Programming Language
Reddit was originally written in Common Lisp but was rewritten in Python some months later.

The reasons given for the switch were the wider access to code libraries and greater development flexibility offered by the new language.

Three years later the project was made available as open source software, and its code is currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).

####History

* **June 2005**: Reddit was founded in Medford by two 22-year-old graduates of the University of Virginia. 

* **November 2005 - January2006**: Reddit merged with Aaron Swartz's company Infogami, and Swartz became an equal owner of the resulting parent company, Not A Bug. 

* **October 2006**: Condé Nast Publications, owner of Wired, acquired Reddit and the team moved to San Francisco.

* **January 2007**: Swartz was fired.

* **End of 2008**: Team expanded.

* **May 2010**: Reddit was named in Lead411's "2010 Hottest San Francisco Companies" list.

* **July 2010**: After explosive traffic growth, Reddit introduced Reddit Gold, offering new features for a price of $3.99/month or $29.99/year. Reddit Gold adds a number of features to the interface, including the ability to display more comments on a page, access to the private subreddit /r/lounge, and notifications whenever one's username is mentioned in a comment.

* **September 2011**: Reddit became operationally independent of Condé Nast, now operating as a separate subsidiary of its parent company, Advance Publications.

* **February 2013**: Reddit began accepting the digital currency bitcoin for its Reddit Gold subscription service through a partnership with bitcoin payment processor Coinbase.

* **October 2014**: Reddit announced Redditmade, a service which allowed moderators to create merchandise for their subreddits.

* **November 2014**: Chief Executive Yishan Wong resigned and co-founder Ohanian returned as the full-time executive chairman. Ellen Pao, Reddit's business and partnerships strategist became the interim chief executive.

* **February 2015**: Redditmade closed.

* **July 2015**: Pao resigned and was replaced by Steve Huffman as CEO.


## Structure
####Development Process
We were unable to locate information relative to the development process of the Reddit software, mainly because a most of its development happened during its closed source period, as of a fact, some of the current contributers acknowledge that there may not even be one process set for it.

**TODO: Try to find the approximate development process used by analysing the repository/code.**

**TODO: The following block of text is out of context/located in the wrong place**

###Scrum
Scrum is a way of software development, where a team is required as solid to reach a goal.
Basically this methodology involves several's sprints, 1 to 3 weeks, having each sprint the follow structure:

1-Plan

2-Build

3-Test

4-Review

To get the final product its necessary 3 Rols. First its the Product owner, who will request the product and pay for it. In second we have the Scrum Master, its the one that will push for the team, helping ensuring success, removing impediments and supporting the team. Finally we have the team, who will build the project.

In the final of each sprint, team will dispute a sprint review (where team can improve the product) and a sprint retrospective (where team can be improved).

If the final product its built after the sprint, team can put the product ready for shippment.
