## Requirement Elicitation

Due to Reddit's nature of being an 'open to everyone' website, where users are able to share, review and comment their content, it makes the requirement elicitation process very straightforward.

By observing what the users share and how they do it, the service is developed towards improving the users experience, by adding new features or improving existing ones, making this Social Observation and Analysis technique most likely the main method to acquire information on the user's needs.

Additionally, a part of the website, is dedicated for users to submit their suggestions and feature requests, this is done through the [ideasfortheadmins](https://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/) subreddit.
