It can be improved by test-driven development and design for testability.
##CUT (Component Under Test): the component being tested

#FIRST
##Controllability: How possible is to control the state of the CUT as required for testing
##Observability: How possible is to observe intermediate and final test results.
##Isolateability: How much CUT can be tested in isolation-
##Separation of concerns: How much every test is separated. i.e. are they all on the same test? are they well separated.
##Understandability: How well is CUT documented and easy to understand.
##Heterogeneity: How many techonologies are required to run all the test methods and tools.


#SECOND
##How many tests? (unitários, sistema, desempenho, etc)
##Coverage of tests (EclEmma, others)

##Find a bug report, create test cases to reproduce it, fix it, using automated software fault diagnosis techniques.
