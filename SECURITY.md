Like all pieces of software, reddit has bugs. And it always will. Some of them will take the form of security vulnerabilities.

When these are found, things will go one of two ways.

The good way: The user who finds the problem quietly lets us know. We pounce on the problem immediately but carefully, figuring out exactly what caused it and how to fix it in at least two different ways. Then we test the fix, make sure it doesn't impact any existing functionality, deploy it, and announce the news.

The bad way: One way or another, the general public finds out about the problem before or at the same time as we do. At this point, some dick will immediately create a full-fledged exploit that takes over other users' accounts, crashes the site, etc. Or sometimes, a nice person accidentally does something like that. Even if nobody does anything bad, we have to respond as if someone could at any moment. Usually when this happens, we're asleep, or having dinner with our in-laws at a fancy restaurant, or in the case of The Great Worm of 2009, we're all on various airplanes flying back across the country from a reddit wedding. We have to panic and shove an untested fix out the door, break functionality, and in general, lose a bunch of sleep and act all ornery the next day.

In the hopes of avoiding the latter scenario, we've created a ["White Hat"]((http://www.reddit.com/wiki/whitehat)) award. Here's how you get one:

1. Find a vulnerability in reddit
2. Privately tell the admins ([security@reddit.com](mailto:security@reddit.com))
3. DON'T FREAKING TELL ANYONE ELSE

Number 3 is very important. If the general public knows about your exploit, you can't get the award. Therefore, if you need a place to experiment, create a private subreddit and do your work there. As much as we hate to say it, it also means you shouldn't collaborate with others. We know that sucks, but we don't really see any way around it: If you create a public reddit community dedicated to finding exploits, it will inevitably be watched closely by at least one jerk, and so anything discovered there will have to be considered "known to the general public" and thus ineligible for the award.
