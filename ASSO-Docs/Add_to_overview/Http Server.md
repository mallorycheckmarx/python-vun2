Http Server

The HTTP server of Reddit can be described as a Model-view-controller.

Depending on the request the Model can behave differently on choosing the database to use when the information is not already present in the model. When there is a update on the data, the model can store it on the database using the cod DB. e present on the THing
The response for a given user GET to the controller is generated by a Template where the html code is avaliable.
This MVC structure in this project is inherited by Pylons, which is a web development library. This structure is not strictly followed on the organization of the reddit server.
